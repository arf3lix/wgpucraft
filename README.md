# Wgpu Minecraft Clone

## Why another minecraft clone?

There will never be enough minecraft clones out there! if i really consider myself a game developer even as a hobbyist (for now), a minecraft clone is a must step i have to take!

## What's different about this minecraft clone?

Im not using any game engine, instead im using a pure graphics library (wgpu) and the rust programming language.

I have seen a couple similar minecraft clones but are pretty basic, in general my objective with this repo is to create a playable minecraft clone similar to this one:  
https://github.com/jdah/minecraft-weekend   
 but as i mentioned, using wgpu and rust.

## why not using a game engine?

Because i'm too cool for that, i like to struggle, and that keeps my mind busy, so i decided that a making game from scratch with a pure graphics library will be a great pain to experience.


## Current state

right now im working in a proper chunk generation system

## Notes

This repository could be said to be an evolution of this one:
https://github.com/xanfe/rust-graphics  
that is where I experimented with wgpu code, but as I began to introduce voxel features, I decided that it would be better to create another repository exclusively for that (this one), even this repo could be leaved behind to create a more specific one if evolves enough.
